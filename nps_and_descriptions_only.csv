Dan Shipper publishes these insightful articles explaining how AI models work, suggesting useful ways to use LLMs, and predicting the future of programming. It gives the impression of having someone's detailed notes—someone we will follow in six months. Additionally, they've developed some apps—Monologue for dictation, Sparkle for file organization, Cora for email (just a short trial, but it was effective). However, to be honest, I am there for the writing. It simply comes out of the noise."

0,"Good until a point.  While the marketing talks about the tools I can use, I did not find out until after I subscribed that the majority are for Mac users.  I joined for the CLaude sessions.  THose were an 8/10.  I find I am getting better, actionaable intel from Substack.  I think you were out of touch offering a High three figure Claude class.  Seems out of touch in the middle of as shutdown from a company that has a consultancy, paid ads on podcast, subscription model and completed a pre-seed.  PLus, did anyone at Every try to use this survey tool?  The text box is so tiny.  It seems odd that a company preaches design and aesthetics has such a poor experience when asking about user experience.  This has convinced me that the ideas that sound good in Every don;t always sound as good outside of Every.  I will finish this survey and cancel my subscriptio.  I wish you well.  Maybe I am not your target."
